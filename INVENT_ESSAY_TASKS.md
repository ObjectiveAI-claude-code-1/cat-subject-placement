1. Evaluate positional intentionality by examining whether the cat's position within the frame feels deliberately chosen rather than accidental. Consider where the cat sits relative to the edges, center, diagonals, and natural anchor points of the photograph. A cat that feels like the reason the frame exists — regardless of whether it is centered, offset, or placed unconventionally — demonstrates strong intentionality. A cat that appears to have drifted into the frame by coincidence, sitting at an edge with no compositional justification or occupying a position that creates no meaningful relationship with the rest of the image, demonstrates weak intentionality. The task is to determine whether the cat's location in the frame communicates a sense of decision — whether the boundaries of the photograph feel like they were drawn around the cat.

2. Evaluate spatial equilibrium by examining the visual balance between the cat and the space that surrounds it. Consider how the cat's visual weight relates to the distribution of space, objects, and negative area throughout the frame. A cat given appropriate breathing room — enough surrounding space to feel situated but not stranded — achieves equilibrium. A cat crammed against an edge with a vast opposing emptiness, or pressed into a corner while irrelevant clutter dominates the rest of the frame, does not. Balance is not the same as symmetry; an asymmetrical image can be perfectly balanced if the visual weights complement each other, such as open space in the direction of a cat's gaze. The task is to determine whether the cat inhabits the frame comfortably or whether there is unresolved tension between the subject and its surrounding space.

3. Evaluate compositional gravity by examining whether the cat serves as a clear and stable center of gravity for the image. Consider whether the viewer's eye is naturally drawn to the cat by the arrangement of shapes, lines, spaces, and visual elements in the scene. When compositional gravity is strong, the background supports the subject, negative space frames rather than competes, and the photograph feels cohesive — everything in the image exists in relation to the cat. When compositional gravity is weak, the viewer's eye wanders with no clear destination, or the cat carries the same visual weight as surrounding objects like furniture or patterns, failing to assert itself as the subject. The task is to determine whether the composition establishes the cat at the top of the visual hierarchy — transforming a photograph that merely contains a cat into one that is unmistakably about a cat.
