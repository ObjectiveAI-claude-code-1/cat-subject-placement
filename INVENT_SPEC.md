Evaluate subject placement and balance within the cat photograph. Examine where the cat is positioned within the frame and determine whether that placement feels purposeful and deliberate. Consider whether the cat anchors the composition with a clear center of gravity — whether the viewer immediately understands where to look. Assess the visual equilibrium between the cat and the surrounding space: the cat should not be crammed against an edge, awkwardly bisected by the frame boundary, or marooned in emptiness without compositional reason. Strong placement means the cat occupies its position with a sense of belonging, as though the frame was drawn around it. Weak placement makes the cat feel accidental — technically present but compositionally absent. This is not about following rigid rules like the rule of thirds. A cat sitting dead center in a quiet frame can feel profoundly intentional. What matters is whether the placement feels chosen.
